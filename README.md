# Simple Filemaker interface with ZohoWriter
- installation: One should be able to install this with composer and set up the .env
environment outside of the website root to allow user to use a label to
connect to the filemaker device in limited form.
- Using Filemaker's monkeybread software program a script has been developed to allow
Filemaker to upload the the Zohowriter document into the website to transfer into the
Filemaker database
